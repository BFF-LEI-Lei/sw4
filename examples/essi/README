This directory contains tests for the ESSI hdf5 output
  implemented by ESSI3D and ESSI3DHDF5 classes.

Using hdf5-parallel assumes a PARALLEL FILE SYSTEM!

The tests can be run on a few processors by:
- Building sw4 with the hdf5=yes option.
- - This may require setting the HDF5 library path in Makefile.

- The first test is M5.5_ESSI_srf.in:
- - Run the test
- - Output is created in M5.5_ESSI_srf
- - Three sets of files are created:
- - - S_XX.[xyz] files, SAC files for surface receiver stations
- - - m5.5_ESSI_srf.cycle=XX.u[xyz].3Dimg files, 3Dimg files for the entire domain
- - - m5.5_ESSI_srf.cycle=XX.essi	files, which contain the ESSI output

- The second test is berkeley-att-h100.in:
- - This also requires you to build sw4 with proj=yes
- - Copy or link performance/rfile/berkeley.rfile directory here
- - Run the test
- - Output is created in berkeley-att-h100
- - Three sets of files are created:
- - - S_XX.[xyz] files, SAC files for surface receiver stations
- - - cycle=XX.u[xyz].3Dimg files, 3Dimg files for the entire domain
- - - cycle=00.essi	file, which contain all ESSI output time steps

- Check the results with MATLAB:
- - Open compare3DimgESSI.m
- - Add the tools directory (..) to the path for reading SAC, 3Dimg files
- - Run the script. Successful results will look like:

  %Found:  prec  = 8 t= 0.077518 plane= -1
  ... (lots of tools .m reader output) ...
  idep    = -12345
  --> M5.5_ESSI_srf spot check of SAC and ESSI passes.
  --> M5.5_ESSI_srf spot check of 3DIMG and ESSI passes.
  %Found:  prec  = 8 t= 0.35341 plane= -1
  ... (lots of tools .m reader output) ...
  idep    = -12345
  --> berkeley-att-h100 spot check of 3DIMG and ESSI z coordinate passes.
  --> berkeley-att-h100 spot check of 3DIMG and ESSI velocities passes.
  --> berkeley-att-h100 spot check of SAC and ESSI passes.
