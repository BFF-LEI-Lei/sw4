\section{The spatial discretization}

In this section, we describe the spatial discretization for the problem (\ref{elastic_curvi}). We firstly introduce the SBP operator for the first and second spatial derivative with scalar variable in one dimension and then extend the SBP operators to vector variables in three dimensions.
