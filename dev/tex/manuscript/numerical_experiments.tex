\section{Numerical Experiments}
In this section, we conduct several numerical experiments. In Section \ref{manufactured_sol}, we compare the efficiency of iterative methods which are used to solve the interface condition system (\ref{traction_gamma_pre}) and (\ref{traction_gamma_corr}), note that the coefficient matrices in (\ref{traction_gamma_pre}) and (\ref{traction_gamma_corr}) are same; verify the order of the convergence of the proposed scheme (\ref{elastic_semi_c}), (\ref{fine_scheme}) and (\ref{continuous_sol})--(\ref{continuous_traction}). In Section \ref{gaussian_source}, we show that there is no obvious reflection at the mesh refinment interface for the proposed scheme (\ref{elastic_semi_c}), (\ref{fine_scheme}) and (\ref{continuous_sol})--(\ref{continuous_traction}) with only a traction force on the top surface. Finally, the energy conservation property is shown in Section \ref{conserved_energy}.
