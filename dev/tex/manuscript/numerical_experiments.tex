\section{Numerical Experiments}
In this section, we conduct several numerical experiments. In Sec.\ref{convergence_study}, we verify the order of the convergence of the proposed scheme (\ref{elastic_semi_c}), (\ref{fine_scheme}) and (\ref{continuous_sol})--(\ref{continuous_traction}). The efficiency of iterative methods which are used to solve the interface condition system (\ref{traction_gamma_pre}) and (\ref{traction_gamma_corr}) is investigated in Sec.\ref{iterative_section}. In Sec.\ref{gaussian_source}, we show that there is no obvious reflection at the mesh refinement interface for the proposed scheme (\ref{elastic_semi_c}), (\ref{fine_scheme}) and (\ref{continuous_sol})--(\ref{continuous_traction}). Finally, the energy conservation property is verified in Section \ref{conserved_energy}.
