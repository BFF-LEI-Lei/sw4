\section{Numerical Experiments}
In this section, we conduct several numerical experiments. In Section \ref{convergence_study}, we verify the order of the convergence of the proposed scheme (\ref{elastic_semi_c}), (\ref{fine_scheme}) and (\ref{continuous_sol})--(\ref{continuous_traction}). The efficiency of iterative methods which are used to solve the interface condition system (\ref{traction_gamma_pre}) and (\ref{traction_gamma_corr}) is shown in Section \ref{iterative_section}, note that the coefficient matrices in (\ref{traction_gamma_pre}) and (\ref{traction_gamma_corr}) are same. In Section \ref{gaussian_source}, we show that there is no obvious reflection at the mesh refinement interface for the proposed scheme (\ref{elastic_semi_c}), (\ref{fine_scheme}) and (\ref{continuous_sol})--(\ref{continuous_traction}) with a traction force on the top surface. Finally, the energy conservation property is shown in Section \ref{conserved_energy}.
