
Output the strain tensor by the command (for example):

sac x=3 y=2 z=4 file=sta1 variables=strains 

It will generate six files: sta1.xx, sta1.xy, sta1.xz, sta1.yy, sta1.yz, sta1.zz 


To use these six components as a source, use the command:

source x=3.0 y=2.0 z=4.0 m0=10 sacbase=sta1

SW4 will read sta1.xx - sta1.zz and use these as time dependent moment tensor
components in a source:

      [ mxx(t) mxy(t) mxz(t) ] [d (delta)/dx ]
  m0* [ mxy(t) myy(t) myz(t) ]*[d (delta)/dy ]
      [ mxz(t) myz(t) mzz(t) ] [d (delta)/dz ]

Notes:
 1. Most parameters to 'source' such as Mxx, Mxy, etc. will be ignored with the sacbase parameter.
    One exception is the amplitude, which can be set by the parameter 'm0'.
 2. Only moment sources are implemented, it is not possible to use three sac files as a point source.
 3. A directory path can be used, e.g., sacbase=pointsource-h0p04/sta1
 4. It is assumed that all six sac files have the same starting point, time step,
    and number of sample points. It is assumed that the utc starting point of the sac
    files is equal to simulation time 0. The offset argument B in the sac file is respected, and
    is assumed to be the same in all six files. 
    The sac data is assumed to be zero for times between 0 and B. For times later than the
    end time of the sac file, the value of the last point in the time series is used. If you want
    this to be zero, you have to ramp down the time series in your sac data preprocessing.
 5. The location of the source is taken from the command line. If geographic coordinates are used,
    a warning message is written if the (lat,lon) coordinates on the sac file do not agree with the
    (lat,lon) given on the 'source' input line. The program will still run.
 6. The sac data are interpolated in time (internally in SW4) by quintic splines, there should 
    be no problem to use different time steps in the computation and in the sac data.
 7. The standard behavior in SW4 and WPP is that the location of the sac stations, specified by 
    the 'sac' command, are always moved to the nearest grid point, but the sources are always 
    discretized accurately at their exact specified location, independently of the grid. This behavior
    is still the same, so that sources specified by the 'sacbase' parameter will be discretized at 
    their precise locations.
